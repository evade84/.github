Work is still in progress. Docs, manuals and more is coming soon.

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] Release +-final version of [evade84-node](https://github.com/evade84/evade84-node).
- [ ] Write some docs and manuals.
- [ ] Release +-final version of [eef](https://github.com/evade84/eef) (maybe even rename it :/).
- [ ] Write some other clients: web, desktop, mobile, pager, toaster, synth, your kitten, etc.
- [ ] Be happy for a while.
- [ ] Rewrite everything in Rust.
- [ ] Forget about this project, 'cause no one cares about it.
